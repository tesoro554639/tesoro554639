### BSIT Student | Aspiring Web Developer | Learning by Building

I’m a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student focused on **web development, databases, and problem-solving**.  
I don’t just “study” tech — I **build projects to understand how things actually work**.

---

## 🚀 Current Focus
- 🌐 Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- 🗄️ Databases & SQL
- 🧠 Data Structures & Programming Logic
- 🔧 Turning school concepts into real projects

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Languages & Tools I Use**
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Beginner → Improving)
- SQL
- Git & GitHub

**Currently Learning**
- Advanced JavaScript
- Backend fundamentals
- Python (soon)

---

## 📌 Projects Worth Looking At
> Not dumping everything here — only what actually matters.

- 🔹 **Student & Database Projects**  
  Practical implementations of SQL, normalization, ERDs, and queries.

- 🔹 **Web Practice Projects**  
  Small but focused websites built to understand layout, logic, and structure.

*(More coming as I build more — quality over noise.)*

---

## 📈 What I Care About
- Clean logic over flashy nonsense
- Understanding fundamentals before frameworks
- Improving every week, not pretending I already “made it”

---

## 📫 Let’s Connect
- GitHub: You’re already here.
- Open to collaboration, feedback, and learning opportunities.
